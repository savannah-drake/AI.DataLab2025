FIFA World Cup 2026™: Transit & Disinvestment in Atlanta
Project overview
This project uses geospatial analysis to examine how business disinvestment and public transit access intersect in Atlanta’s Neighborhood Statistical Areas (NSAs) around Mercedes‑Benz Stadium. It focuses on identifying high‑disinvestment neighborhoods that also have limited MARTA access and are close to the stadium.

Research questions
Where are disinvested businesses concentrated across Atlanta NSAs?

How does MARTA stop availability align with NSAs that have high levels of disinvestment?

Which high‑disinvestment NSAs near Mercedes‑Benz Stadium have particularly low transit access?

Data sources
Atlanta NSA boundary shapefile (atl_mobility_nsa.shp)

City of Atlanta business license data with latitude/longitude and disinvestment flag (atl_bus_license_data.csv)

MARTA stops shapefile (MARTA_Stops.shp)

Mercedes‑Benz Stadium coordinates (hard‑coded point)

Methods
Convert business license records to spatial points and project them to the NSA shapefile CRS.

Spatially join businesses to NSAs and compute, for each NSA:

disinvested_count

total_businesses

disinvested_share

Spatially join MARTA stops to NSAs and compute marta_stops per NSA.

Construct a combined NSA table (nsa_complete) with disinvestment metrics and MARTA stop counts.

Filter to high‑disinvestment NSAs (e.g., disinvested_count >= 50).

Compute centroid‑to‑stadium distance (dist_km) for each NSA.

Build a “high‑priority” subset of NSAs that are:

highly disinvested,

have relatively low MARTA access, and

are geographically close to Mercedes‑Benz Stadium.

Key outputs
Map of disinvested businesses over Atlanta NSAs.

Choropleth of NSAs shaded by disinvested business counts.

Ranked visualizations and tables of:

NSAs with high disinvestment and their MARTA access.
